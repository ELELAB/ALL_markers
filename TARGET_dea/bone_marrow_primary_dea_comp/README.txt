* INTRODUCTION *

This directory (TARGET_dea) performs differential expression analysis of 
TARGET-ALL-P2 gene expression data. This directory contains the following 
subdirectories where differential expression analysis is performed:

1. limma_voom
- Here, differential expression analysis is performed using the
  limma-voom method

2. deseq2
- Here, differential expression analysis is performed using the
  DESeq2 method

3. edgeR
- Here, differential expression analysis is performed using the
  edgeR method

4. gene_counts_DEA
- Here, visualizations of gene counts for the three above methods
  are created

5. visualization_DEA
- Here, visualizations of differential expression analysis results
  found using the three above methods are created

6. compare_DEA
- Here, comparisons of results of differential expression analysis
  using the three above methods are carried out
